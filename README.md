here we study about the python basics to advance level 
Python is a versatile and powerful high-level programming language that has gained immense popularity over the years. It was created by Guido van Rossum and was first released in 1991. Python is known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of use, making it an ideal language for beginners and experienced developers alike.

Key features of Python include:

Readable and Clean Syntax: Python uses indentation to define blocks of code, enhancing code readability. Its straightforward and expressive syntax allows developers to write code that is easy to understand.

Interpreted Language: Python is an interpreted language, which means that code is executed line by line, without the need for compilation. This makes development and debugging more straightforward and flexible.

Cross-platform Compatibility: Python code can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, without any modifications. This cross-platform compatibility contributes to its popularity and widespread adoption.

Large Standard Library: Python comes with a vast standard library that provides numerous modules and functions, making it convenient for developers to perform various tasks without having to write code from scratch.

Community and Libraries: Python has a vast and active community of developers, which has resulted in the creation of numerous third-party libraries and frameworks that extend its capabilities for various purposes, such as web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Python supports object-oriented programming, allowing developers to structure their code using classes and objects, making it easier to manage complex projects.

To get started with Python, you need to follow these steps:

Install Python: Visit the official Python website (https://www.python.org/) and download the latest version of Python. Install it on your computer following the provided instructions.

Writing Your First Python Program: Python programs can be written using any text editor, but for beginners, it's recommended to use a code editor with syntax highlighting. The most basic program is the "Hello, World!" program, which prints the text "Hello, World!" to the console. Here's the code:

python
Copy code
print("Hello, World!")
Running Python Code: Save the above code in a file with a ".py" extension (e.g., hello.py). Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the file is saved, and run the program using the python command:
Copy code
python hello.py
Learning the Basics: Once you've executed your first program successfully, you can dive into learning the basics of Python, including variables, data types, control structures (if-else, loops), functions, and more. Many online resources, tutorials, and books are available for beginners to learn Python.

Practice and Projects: The best way to solidify your Python skills is through practice and building small projects. Start with simple exercises and gradually work on more challenging tasks.

Python's versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, automation, and scripting. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, Python offers a welcoming and dynamic environment for your programming journey. Happy coding!
# Basic Input and Output

# Prompt the user to enter their name
name = input("Enter your name: ")

# Prompt the user to enter their age
age = input("Enter your age: ")

# Convert the age input from string to integer
age = int(age)

# Calculate the year when the user will turn 100 years old
current_year = 2023
years_to_100 = 100 - age
year_of_100 = current_year + years_to_100

# Display a greeting and the year when the user will turn 100
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
print(f"You will turn 100 years old in the year {year_of_100}.")
it will prompt you to enter your name and age. After entering the information, the program will calculate the year when you will turn 100 and display a greeting along with that year.
 here's a Python code that demonstrates slicing of strings, lists, and tuples:
 string_example = "Hello, World!"

# Get a slice of the string from index 0 to index 4 (exclusive)
sliced_string = string_example[0:5]
print("Sliced String:", sliced_string)  # Output: "Hello"

# Get a slice of the string from index 7 to the end
sliced_string = string_example[7:]
print("Sliced String:", sliced_string)  # Output: "World!"

# Get a slice of the string from the beginning to index 5 (exclusive)
sliced_string = string_example[:5]
print("Sliced String:", sliced_string)  # Output: "Hello"

# Slicing a List
list_example = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Get a slice of the list from index 2 to index 5 (exclusive)
sliced_list = list_example[2:5]
print("Sliced List:", sliced_list)  # Output: [3, 4, 5]

# Get a slice of the list from index 4 to the end
sliced_list = list_example[4:]
print("Sliced List:", sliced_list)  # Output: [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Get a slice of the list from the beginning to index 3 (exclusive)
sliced_list = list_example[:3]
print("Sliced List:", sliced_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]

# Slicing a Tuple
tuple_example = (11, 12, 13, 14, 15)

# Get a slice of the tuple from index 1 to index 4 (exclusive)
sliced_tuple = tuple_example[1:4]
print("Sliced Tuple:", sliced_tuple)  # Output: (12, 13, 14)

# Get a slice of the tuple from index 2 to the end
sliced_tuple = tuple_example[2:]
print("Sliced Tuple:", sliced_tuple)  # Output: (13, 14, 15)

# Get a slice of the tuple from the beginning to index 2 (exclusive)
sliced_tuple = tuple_example[:2]
print("Sliced Tuple:", sliced_tuple)  # Output: (11, 12)
we have examples of slicing a string, a list, and a tuple using the slicing notation [start:stop]. The start index is inclusive, and the stop index is exclusive. If the start index is not specified, it defaults to 0, and if the stop index is not specified, it defaults to the end of the sequence.
In Python, you can use the index() method to find the index of a specific element in a list or a string. The index() method returns the first occurrence of the specified element. If the element is not found, it raises a ValueError. Here's an example of how to use the index() method:
# Index in a List
numbers_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Find the index of the element 30
index_of_30 = numbers_list.index(30)
print("Index of 30:", index_of_30)  # Output: 2

# Index in a String
text = "Hello, World!"

# Find the index of the letter 'o'
index_of_o = text.index('o')
print("Index of 'o':", index_of_o)  # Output: 4

# Index with Start and End Parameters in a List
animals_list = ['cat', 'dog', 'rabbit', 'cat', 'hamster']

# Find the index of the element 'cat' starting from index 1
index_of_cat = animals_list.index('cat', 1)
print("Index of 'cat' after index 1:", index_of_cat)  # Output: 3

# Find the index of the element 'hamster' up to index 4
index_of_hamster = animals_list.index('hamster', 0, 4)
print("Index of 'hamster' before index 4:", index_of_hamster)  # Output: 4
In the first example, we use the index() method to find the index of the element 30 in the numbers_list. It returns 2, which is the index of 30 in the list.

In the second example, we use the index() method to find the index of the letter 'o' in the text string. It returns 4, which is the index of the first occurrence of 'o' in the string.

In the last two examples, we use the optional start and end parameters of the index() method. The start parameter specifies the index from which the search starts, and the end parameter specifies the index at which the search ends. These parameters allow you to search for the element within a specific range in the list. If the element is not found within the specified range, a ValueError is raised.
